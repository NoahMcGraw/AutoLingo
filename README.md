# AutoLingo - Generated Flash Cards for Learning a New Language

This project's original idea was to generate a flash card deck of english to spanish flash cards in order to help me study for my trip to Spain. It connects two api integrations together in order to grab a list of english words and then pass them through the Microsoft translator api to find their Spanish equivelant.

# Required Setup

## Init npm

`npm i`
